Division algorithm (A/B):

1.  Read input values;
2.  Compare input values. Wait until comparison process has finished; (~10 Ticks)
3.  If A<B go to step 10. If A>B, go to next step;
4.  Subtract B from A;
5.  Wait until subtraction process has finished; (~80 Ticks)
6.  Add one to count;
7.  Wait until counting process has finished; (~50 Ticks)
8.  Write value from subtraction process to input;
9.  Go to step 1;
10. A<B. Therefore answer is Count remainder A.
